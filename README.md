# realtime-caller

This demo is using twilio's voice sockets to feed voice data into openai realtime model. Then returning openais voice payload back to twilio for phone call with an ai.

I used this post as a refrence, but built with golang. https://www.twilio.com/en-us/blog/twilio-openai-realtime-api-launch-integration 

I am using ngrok as a domain. Need to update .env with your values.
